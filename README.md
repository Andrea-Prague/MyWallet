To be added:
- styling and better UX
- date of the transaction
- daily, monthly and total overview

To be fixed:
- deleting transactions on TransactionList needs deleting them also in dtb
- steps: open a transaction for edit, change the switch to out or in, change amount, switch changes back - desired state is that the switch stays where it was
- color on switch in transaction lists
